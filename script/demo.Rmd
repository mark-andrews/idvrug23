## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, fig.cap='My figure; this is a scatterplot'}
ggplot(pressure, mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
